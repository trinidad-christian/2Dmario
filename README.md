# 2D Mario-Inspired Platformer (Java + LWJGL)

This is a 2D platformer game inspired by **Super Mario**, built using **Java** and the **Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL)**.  
I'm using this project to learn the fundamentals of game development, OpenGL, and real-time rendering.

> ⚠️ Mario is a placeholder — I plan to develop my own unique characters and game world in the future!
